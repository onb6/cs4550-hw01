I ended up having to use VMWare Fusion to create my Debian 10 VM, because I was having compatibility issues with VirtualBox on Big Sur. There seemed to be a missing driver after installation that prevented me from being able to create the VM, and there were a lot of people on the internet with the same problem. For this reason I decided to use VMWare Fusion instead.
